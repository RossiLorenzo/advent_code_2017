# Advent of Code - 2017

My solutions to the awesome [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com/2017) 2017. 

## Structure and Notes

For every day of the advent of code you can find the input I was given, the text files with Part1 and Part2 of the challenge and my R code to solve the challenge.

Even if I tried to write all the code in R, for a few challenges I had to use Rcpp to speed up the computations so in the repo you might find some C++ code as well here and there.

Finally, the R file CreateDay.R is just an utility that I use to quickly create the structure of the `Day` folders.

## The tree

Here you can see the growing bitmap-art tree growing in time:
